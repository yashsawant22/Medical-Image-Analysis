![Project Logo](logo.png) (Optional)

## Description

This project focuses on the accurate prediction of fetal gestational age from real-world ultrasound images, using a combination of computer vision techniques, TensorFlow, and Principal Component Analysis (PCA). The project employs Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to analyze medical images and provides a deep learning model for precise gestational age estimation. This README outlines the key aspects of the project, from data preprocessing to neural network model building and dimensionality reduction.

## Data Preprocessing

This project begins with the collection of real-world ultrasound images from 100 patients, totaling 2000 images. The OpenCV library is employed to preprocess these images. Key data preprocessing steps include:

- Image rescaling and normalization to enhance image quality.
- Loading and formatting the ultrasound image dataset.
- Data preparation for use in the subsequent analysis.

## Data Augmentation

To improve the quality of the dataset and enhance the accuracy of the neural network model, data augmentation is performed. This step increases the robustness of the model by introducing variations into the dataset. Techniques such as image rotation, scaling, and flipping are applied to create a more diverse training dataset.

## Convolutional Neural Network Model

The core of this project is the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model. TensorFlow, a deep learning framework in Python, is used to build the model. The CNN is specifically designed to analyze medical images and predict fetal gestational age with high accuracy. The model can confidently estimate gestational age, achieving an accuracy rate of 89%.

The CNN architecture includes convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers, making it capable of handling complex image data.

## Dimensionality Reduction (PCA)

This project employs Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction. PCA is applied to enhance the efficiency of the model. The dimensionality reduction process involves:

- Rescaling image pixel values to a range between 0 and 1.
- Applying PCA to the training dataset to reduce its dimensionality.
- Examining the variance explained by each principal component.
- Selecting a suitable number of principal components for dimensionality reduction.
- Transforming the training and testing datasets using PCA.
